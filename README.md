# image-captioning-hybrid-model
This repository contains an image captioning system that combines a CNN for feature extraction and an RNN (LSTM) for text generation. The model is trained on the Flickr8k dataset, leveraging pre-trained VGG16 and embedding layers to generate meaningful captions for images.
